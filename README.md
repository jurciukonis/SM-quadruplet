# Standard Model Extended with an *SU(2)* Quadruplet

In this analysis, we consider an extension of the Standard Model by an *SU(2)* quadruplet of scalars with hypercharge 0, 1/2, or 3/2. Using exact analytical equations, we establish the boundaries of the phase spaces corresponding to the gauge-invariant terms that appear in the scalar potentials, as illustrated in the figure below.

*Figure: The boundaries of the phase spaces are shown for the case *Y = 0* (top-left panel), *Y = 3/2* (top-right panel), *Y = 1/2* (bottom-left panel), and the non-renormalizable case *Y = 1/2* (bottom-right panel).*
