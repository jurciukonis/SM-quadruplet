# SM-quadruplet

The Mathematica files with computation examples for the paper "On the addition of an SU(2) quadruplet of scalars to the Standard Model".

- The Mathematica notebook with examples for the model with hypercharge Y = 0 ["RGEs_for_multiplets.nb"](https://github.com/jurciukonis/RGEs_for_multiplets/blob/main/RGEs_for_multiplets.nb).

- The definitions of the multiplets and the expressions of the RGEs are given in ["Definitions_and_RGEs.pdf"](https://github.com/jurciukonis/RGEs_for_multiplets/blob/main/Definitions_and_RGEs.pdf).

- [SARAH](http://sarah.hepforge.org/) model files are available in the folder ["SM+Multiplet"](https://github.com/jurciukonis/RGEs_for_multiplets/tree/main/SM+Multiplet).

- The computed RGEs are available in the folder ["Output"](https://github.com/jurciukonis/RGEs_for_multiplets/blob/main/Output).

- For more information about the models and obtained results see refs. [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.XXXXX)] and [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05272)].
